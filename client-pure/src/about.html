      <h2>About the Streaming API</h2>
      <p>The Streaming API offered by Companies House makes it possible to listen for changes to the companies
        register.</p>
      <p>It uses a long-running HTTP endpoint, similar to <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events" target="_blank">Server Sent
        Events</a> (SSE).</p>

      <h2>About this website <code>companies.stream</code></h2>
      <p>This website is primarily designed as a developer tool for devs working with the Streaming API.</p>
      <p>
        It shows the status of the various streams, as well as how much activity there currently is.
        This helps developers correctly diagnose problems with their application if they aren't getting any events.
      </p>
      <p>
        The application code is fully open source and available in the GitHub repository
        <code><a href="https://github.com/mrbrianevans/companies-house-stream" target="_blank">mrbrianevans/companies-house-stream</a></code>.

      <h2>About Companies House</h2>
      <p>
        Companies House is a government organisation in the UK.
        Registered companies file annual accounts with them and they publish company data on a public register.
      </p>
      <p>
        A non-technical interface for this data can be found at
        <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Find and update company
          information</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Companies House offers multiple data products, which can be used by software developers to extract useful
        datasets about UK companies.
        More information about each of their data products can be found on <a href="https://chguide.co.uk/streams"
                                                                              target="_blank">CH Guide</a>,
        which I started to collect related information about the data products. At a high level, there are three main
        ways to access Companies House data:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>bulk data files</li>
        <li>REST API (JSON)</li>
        <li>Streaming API</li>
      </ul>
