    <p>Companies Stream provides a service to backfill past events.</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <p>When building a Companies House data integration, teams usually are required to build an ETL or ELT pipeline to
      load each of the bulk data files from Companies House, and then also build an integration with the Streaming API
      to keep the dataset up to date.</p>
    <p>What if you could simply build one data pipeline to ingest events from the Streaming API, and backfill all
      relevant historical data through that pipeline to get started?</p>
    <p>Companies Stream has saved events that have come through since the start of 2026, and makes them available via a
      web service exposing the same API as the official Companies House Streaming API endpoints, but allowing you to
      start much further back in the stream.</p>

  </section>

  <section>
    <p>It's backed by a private event store that goes back further than the 10 days which Companies House keep available
      on their streaming endpoints.</p>
    <p>Persons with Significant Control events go all the way back to 2022.</p>
    <p>The officer endpoint has all active officers, since they were all run through the system in late 2025 for
      identity verification.</p>

    <p>If you would like to go further back, we can by special arrangement provide all events since June 2024.</p>
