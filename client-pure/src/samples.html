    <h2>Schemas</h2>
    <p>
      These are <a href="https://json-schema.org/" target="_blank">JSON schemas</a> generated from events sent on the
      streams.
      They are categorised by <code>resource_kind</code> rather than stream,
      because some streams (such as persons with significant control) send multiple resource kinds.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can convert these schemas to a language structure using <a href="https://app.quicktype.io/">quicktype</a>.
      Choose a language from the dropdown and then click "convert schemas to language".
      If there is a language that you would like that isn't already on the list, open an issue on the repository for me
      to add it.
